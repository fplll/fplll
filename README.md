# fplll #

## Overall description ##

fplll is distributed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](COPYING) (either version 2.1 of
the License, or, at your option, any later version) as published by the Free Software Foundation.

fplll contains several algorithms on lattices that rely on floating-point computations. This
includes implementations of the floating-point LLL reduction algorithm, offering different
speed/guarantees ratios. It contains a 'wrapper' choosing the estimated best sequence of variants in
order to provide a guaranteed output as fast as possible. In the case of the wrapper, the succession
of variants is oblivious to the user. It also includes a rigorous floating-point implementation of
the Kannan-Fincke-Pohst algorithm that finds a shortest non-zero lattice vector, and the BKZ
reduction algorithm.

## Dependencies ##

### Required ###

- GNU MP 4.2.0 or higher [http://gmplib.org/](http://gmplib.org/)
- MPFR 2.3.0 or higher, COMPLETE INSTALLATION [http://www.mpfr.org/](http://www.mpfr.org/)
- autotools 2.61 or higher

### Optional ###
- QD 2.3.15 or higher (a C++/Fortran-90 double-double and quad-double package), compile and install
  the shared library (e.g `./configure --enable-shared=yes`).
  [http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/](http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/)

If GMP and/or MPFR include and lib files are not in the default directories `/usr/include` and
`/usr/lib`, you have to set the environment variables `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` for instance through the
configure command line

```./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/mpfrinclude -I/gmpinclude" LDFLAGS="-L/mpfrlib -L/gmplib"```

or

```./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/mpfrinclude -I/gmpinclude $CPPFLAGD" LDFLAGS="-L/mpfrlib -L/gmplib $LDFLAGS"```

if these variables already exist in your environment. This should be modified soon for using
standard `--with-gmp` and `--with-mpfr` package specifications. The same philosophy applies to the
(optional) QD library.

## Installation ##

You should downloaded the source code from github and then run

    ./autogen.sh

which generates the `./configure` script used to configure fplll by calling the appropriate
autotools command.

Then, to compile and install type

	./configure
	make
	make install			# (as root)

You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source code directory by typing `make
clean`. To also remove the files that `./configure` created (so you can compile the package for a
different kind of computer), type `make distclean`.  By default, `make install` installs the package
commands under `/usr/local/bin`, include files under `/usr/local/include`, etc.  You can specify an
installation directory name other than `/usr/local` by giving `./configure` the option
`--prefix=dirname`.  Run `./configure --help` for further details.

## Check ##

Type

	make check


## How to use ##

Executable files `fplll` and `latticegen` are installed in the directory
bin. If you type 'make check', it will also generate the file llldiff.
(Note that the programs generated by make in the 'src/' directory are
only wrappers to the programs in 'src/.libs/)

### latticegen ###

`latticegen` is an utility for generating matrices (rows form input
lattice bases).

The options are :

* `r` `d` `b` : generates a knapsack style matrix of dimension d,d+1 and b bits.
* `s` `d` `b` `b2` : generates a simdioph matrix.
* `u` `d` `b` : generates an uniform matrix.
* `n` `d` `b` `q` : generates an ntru like matrix.
* `N` `d` `b` `q` : generates an ntru like matrix.
* `a` `d` `f` : generates an ajtai style matrix.
* `A` `d` : generates an ajtai style matrix. Also requires d coefficients.

The matrix is printed in stdout.

Note that by default, the random bits always use the same seed,
to ensure reproducibility. You can change the seed with the option
``` -randseed <integer>``` or use the current time (in seconds)
``` -randseed time```

If you use this option, it must be the first one on the command line.

### fplll ###

`fplll` does LLL, BKZ or SVP on a matrix (considered as a set of row vectors) given in stdin or in a
file as parameter.

The options are:

* `-a lll` : LLL-reduction (default).
* `-a bkz` : BKZ-reduction.
* `-a svp` : print a shortest vector of the lattice.
* `-r` `size`, `-c` `size` : ignored, provided for compatibility with previous versions of fplll.

Options for LLL-reduction:

* `-d delta` :     delta (default=0.99)
* `-e eta` :       eta (default=0.51)
* `-l lovasz` :    if !=0 Lovasz's condition. Otherwise, Siegel's condition (default: Lovasz)
* `-p precision` : precision of the floating-point arithmetic, works only with -f mpfr.

* `-f mpfr` : sets the floating-point type to MPFR (default if m=proved).
* `-f dd` : sets the floating-point type to double-double.
* `-f qd` : sets the floating-point type to quad-double.
* `-f dpe` : sets the floating-point type to DPE (default if m=heuristic/heuristicearly).
* `-f double` : sets the floating-point type to double (default if m=fast/fastearly).
* `-f longdouble` : sets the floating-point type to long double.

* `-z int` : sets the integer type to int.
* `-z mpz` : sets the integer type to mpz, the integer type of GMP (default).
* `-z double` : sets the integer type to double.

* `-m wrapper` : uses the wrapper. (default if z=mpz)
* `-m fast` : uses the fast method, works only with -f double.
* `-m fastearly` : uses the fast method with early reduction, works only with -f double.
* `-m heuristic` : uses the heuristic method.
* `-m heuristicearly` : uses the heuristic method with early reduction.
* `-m proved` : uses the proved version of the algorithm.

With the wrapper or the proved version, it is guaranteed that the basis is LLL-reduced with δ'=2×δ-1
and η'=2×η-1/2. For instance, with the default options, it is guaranteed that the basis is
(0.98,0.52)-LLL-reduced.

Options for BKZ-reduction:

* `-b blocksize`             Block size, mandatory, between 2 and the number of rows.
* `-f float`_type            Same as LLL (-p is required if float_type=mpfr)
* `-p precision`             Precision of the floating-point arithmetic with -f mpfr
* `-bkzmaxloops loops`       Maximum number of full loops.
* `-bkzmaxtime time`         Stop after <i>time</i> seconds (up to loop completion).
* `-bkzautoabort`            Heuristic, stop when the average slope of log(||b_i*||) does not decrease fast enough.
* `-bpre blocksize`          Pre-processing block size. Between 2 and the block size.
* `-bkzlinearpruning level`  Enables linear pruning in enumeration, such that the last level steps drop with slope -1/blockSize
* `-bkzdumgso file`_name    Dumps the log(||b_i*||)'s in specified file.

### llldiff ###

`llldiff` compares two bases (b1,...,bd) and (c1,...c_d'): they are considered
equal iff d=d' and for any i, bi = +- ci.

## How to use as a library ##

See [API documentation](library.md).

## Examples ##

	1. Reduction
	./latticegen r 10 1000 | ./fplll

	2. Fileinput for Reduction
	If the file 'matrix' contains

	[[ 10 11]
	[11 12]]

	Then

	./fplll matrix

	produces

	[[0 1 ]
	[1 0 ]
	]

	3. Random generator
	./latticegen -randseed 1234 r 10 1000 | ./fplll
	./latticegen -randseed time u 10 16 | ./fplll

	4. Solving SVP
	./latticegen r 30 3000 | ./fplll -a svp
